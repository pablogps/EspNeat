# EspNeat
Welcome to my EspNeat project. This program will allow you to evolve module-based neural controllers in your Unity projects. During these days I will upload several readme files with licence information, a general overview of the code, and some advice on how to use EspNeat in your project, and on how to use it once it is working to evolve your neural networks.
